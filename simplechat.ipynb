      "### Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 1: Cook the Lentils\n",
      "1. Rinse the toor dal under running water until the water runs clear.\n",
      "2. In a pressure cooker, combine the rinsed dal with 3 cups of water and a pinch of turmeric. Cook for about 3-4 whistles or until soft. If using a pot, boil until the dal is fully cooked and mushy. Set aside.\n",

      "1. In a large saucepan, add chopped mixed vegetables, tomatoes, green chilies, and chopped onion (if using).\n",

      "1. Once the vegetables are cooked, add the cooked dal to the vegetable mixture.\n",
      "2. Stir in the tamarind pulp, sambar powder, salt, and remaining turmeric powder. Adjust the water for desired consistency. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Tempering\n",
      "1. In a small frying pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat.\n",
      "2. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add cumin seeds, dried red chilies, and curry leaves. Sauté for a few seconds.\n",
      "3. If using, add a pinch of asafoetida and cook for another 30 seconds.\n",
      "4. Pour the tempering over the simmering sambar and stir well.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 5: Garnish and Serve\n",
      "1. Turn off the heat and garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.\n",
      "2. Serve hot with steamed rice, dosa, or idli, and enjoy your delicious sambar!\n",
